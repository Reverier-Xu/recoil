# Subagent Common Prompt Template

Copy this into every reviewer child's task, then append the lane-specific
"FILES YOU OWN" and focus hints.

You are a senior Rust code quality reviewer. The project under review is
"recoil" at the repository root — a Rust 2024 workspace shipping an
IDE-style terminal emulator built on GPUI through the pinned woocraft
dependency. Its roadmap (docs/roadmap.md) defines planned module
boundaries: recoil-core (headless domain model: config, profiles, session
metadata, classification, persistence) and recoil-term (GPUI app: workspace
shell, terminal surface, session ownership stores, configuration, SSH,
panels, tray). Project principles: forbid unsafe, no unwrap()/expect() in
production, all GUI types through woocraft re-exports, terminal hot path
isolated from peripheral UI, every user-facing string an i18n key,
simplest design that preserves ownership.

Review ONLY the files assigned to you. Read them fully (use the read tool;
files may exceed 2000 lines so read in chunks). Analyze the code against
these 7 quality dimensions:

1. THIN WRAPPERS: functions/types that merely delegate without adding value;
   error-remapping wrappers that discard information; traits/interfaces with
   exactly one impl that no other type implements; pub functions that only
   forward to a private twin.
2. CROSS-MODULE RESPONSIBILITY COUPLING: module A reaching into module B's
   internals; work done in the wrong module per the roadmap boundaries;
   mod A knowing B's private types; circular conceptual dependency.
3. DUPLICATED HELPER LOGIC: the same logic reimplemented in multiple
   files/modules — canonical text encoding, hex/base64 helpers, time
   conversion, error construction, hash/credential derivation, limit
   validation, sorted-insert, option-unwrapping patterns. Give exact
   file:line pairs for each duplicate.
4. POOR HELPER FACTORING: oversized god-functions; too many tiny one-off
   private helpers; helpers living in the wrong module (private in one mod
   but semantically needed by another, forcing duplication); inconsistent
   naming; names that lie about behavior.
5. OVER-ABSTRACTION: generic parameters that never vary; trait layers with
   a single impl and no plan; macros that could be plain functions;
   speculative extensibility with zero current callers; enum+match replacing
   simple data; dyn dispatch where concrete suffices.
6. HARDCODED IF-ELSE SPECIAL-CASING: if/else or match chains keyed on string
   literals or magic values that decide behavior (should be data-driven
   tables/registry/enum dispatch); per-kind hardcoded branches duplicating
   data that already exists in a registry; cascading boolean flags.
7. HARDCODED STRINGS WHERE EXTENSIBILITY NEEDED: magic string literals used
   as identifiers/keys/labels/feature names/errors that should be typed
   constants, enums, or registry entries; stringly-typed public API; string
   concatenation to build keys a structured type should represent.

Output a markdown report: one section per dimension. For each finding:
severity (P0 blocker / P1 should-fix / P2 nice-to-have / P3 nit), file:line,
one-line description, concrete suggested fix. Be precise — cite real code
with exact paths and line numbers. If a dimension has NO findings in your
files, state that explicitly. Do NOT modify any files — read-only review.
Keep report under ~450 lines.

## Lane Templates

### protocol + identity

```text
FILES YOU OWN (protocol + identity):
- src/protocol/mod.rs, src/protocol/cbor.rs, src/protocol/credential.rs,
  src/protocol/envelope.rs, src/protocol/feature.rs, src/protocol/handshake.rs,
  src/protocol/offer.rs, src/protocol/selection.rs, src/protocol/tag.rs,
  src/protocol/wire.rs
- src/identity/mod.rs, src/identity/admission.rs, src/identity/admission_rate.rs,
  src/identity/credential.rs, src/identity/deletion.rs, src/identity/genesis.rs,
  src/identity/id.rs, src/identity/lifecycle.rs, src/identity/records.rs,
  src/identity/signature.rs, src/identity/testing.rs, src/identity/value.rs

Pay special attention to: handshake state machine vs selection/offer
duplication; credential handling split between protocol/credential.rs and
identity/credential.rs; admission_rate logic duplication; if-else chains on
string kind/schema identifiers; hardcoded magic strings in feature labels,
tags, wire kinds.
```

### transport + session + packet + node

```text
FILES YOU OWN (transport + session + packet + node):
- src/transport/mod.rs, cert.rs, connection.rs, connection/tests.rs,
  endpoint.rs, tls.rs, verify.rs, ws.rs
- src/session/mod.rs, driver.rs, stream.rs, tests.rs
- src/packet/mod.rs, wire.rs
- src/node/mod.rs, builder.rs, event.rs, handle.rs

Pay special attention to: session driver vs stream responsibilities; endpoint
vs connection thin wrappers; TLS/verify/ws separation; packet wire encoding
vs protocol/wire.rs duplication; node builder coupling to session/transport
internals; hardcoded strings in connection setup and error messages.
```

### storage + provider + runtime + simulation

```text
FILES YOU OWN (storage + provider + runtime + simulation):
- src/storage/mod.rs, contract.rs, pending.rs, receipt.rs, json/*.rs
- src/provider.rs
- src/runtime/mod.rs, lifecycle.rs, supervisor.rs
- src/simulation/mod.rs, artifact.rs, event.rs, fixture.rs, network.rs,
  redaction.rs, scenario.rs, topology.rs

Pay special attention to: oversized contract.rs — is it a god-module;
json/helpers.rs vs json/document.rs vs store.rs helper overlap; pending.rs
vs receipt.rs vs contract.rs transaction logic duplication; provider.rs thin
wrappers; simulation/network.rs vs topology.rs overlap; hardcoded string keys
in JSON documents, storage families, redaction categories; if-else chains on
family/kind identifiers.
```

### facade + cross-cutting

```text
FILES YOU OWN (facade + cross-cutting duplication scan):
- src/lib.rs, src/api.rs, src/config.rs, src/error.rs, src/operation.rs,
  src/view.rs, src/extension_registry.rs
- PLUS a cross-module duplication scan across the ENTIRE src/ tree: use
  grep/bash to find repeated helper logic — 'fn encode', 'hex', 'base64',
  'canonical', id to_string, time conversion, error mapping, limit checks,
  sorted inserts, digest computations — appearing in 2+ modules with similar
  bodies. Report exact duplicate pairs with file:line.

Pay special attention to: lib.rs as a facade (thin re-export vs meaningful
surface); api.rs vs lib.rs vs view.rs split; config.rs hardcoded defaults vs
constants; error.rs variant mapping duplication; the extension registry
pattern vs hardcoded string registries elsewhere; whether typed enums replace
stringly identifiers.
